This config file is designed for use with the weather gif builing program.
It is a list of variables which the program uses to translate information 
onto a template. Each variable should be on its own line, with the variable 
name on one side of an equal sign, and its integer value on the other with 
a single space on either side of the equal sign. The default values are 
zero.
